# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

* Fix: Boolean columns can now be filtered by the text they display. A boolean column stores a raw `bool` but renders `trueText` / `falseText` (`Yes` / `No` by default), while the filter only ever compared against `true` / `false`, so typing the visible text matched nothing. Both representations now match, and the raw `true` / `false` keeps working. Reported through #414. @doonfrs @Baghdady92
* Feature: Added opt-in dropdown modes for the column filter row. `TrinaFilterColumnWidgetDelegate.booleanSelect()` renders an ALL / true / false dropdown that labels its options with the column's `trueText` / `falseText`, and `.multiSelect(...)` renders a checkbox dropdown with a Select all toggle that re-filters live on every change. Defaults are untouched: a column keeps its text filter unless one of the new delegates is set. The ALL and Select all labels are localizable via `TrinaGridLocaleText.filterAll` / `filterSelectAll`. @Baghdady92
* Fix: `TrinaGridChangeColumnFilterEvent` now also updates the filter type of an existing filter row for the column, not just its value. A row previously created with another type (e.g. Contains through the filter popup or `setColumnFilter`) kept comparing with the old semantics when the filter row widget sent an update. @Baghdady92

* Feature: Added `TrinaGridConfiguration.fromTheme(context)` and `TrinaGridStyleConfig.fromTheme`/`fromColorScheme`, deriving the grid colors from the app's Material `ColorScheme` so the grid follows the host theme and its brightness. Opt-in: the existing light and dark palettes are unchanged (#336). @doonfrs @stan-at-work
* Fix: `TrinaGridStyleConfig.copyWith` no longer drops `rowCheckedColor`, `rowHoveredColor`, `enableRowHoverColor` and `cellDefaultColor`. It rebuilt the style through the public light/dark constructors, which do not accept those fields, so any customized value silently reverted to the default. These are now also settable through `copyWith`, along with `cellDirtyColor`, `frozenRowColor` and `frozenRowBorderColor`. @doonfrs
* Fix: The hidden-columns popup now inherits the grid's own configuration instead of rebuilding from a fresh default light or dark one, so custom and theme-derived styles reach it. @doonfrs
* Feature: Added `checkReadOnly` to `TrinaRow` and `TrinaCell`, so read-only conditions can be declared per row or per cell instead of only per column. The first callback that is set wins: cell, then row, then column, then the static `TrinaColumn.readOnly` (#404). @doonfrs
* Feature: Added `stateManager.refreshReadOnly()` to re-evaluate the read-only styling of the cells on screen. Read-only enforcement was already live, but the styling is memoized per cell and could go stale when a `checkReadOnly` callback depended on state outside its row (#404). @doonfrs
* Fix: The record sidebar now honors `checkReadOnly`. It only read the static `TrinaColumn.readOnly`, so it let users edit fields the grid itself blocked (#404). @doonfrs
* Fix: `setRowHeight` and `resetRowHeight` no longer drop the row `metadata` when rebuilding the row. @doonfrs
* Feature: Added `horizontalScrollPhysics` and `verticalScrollPhysics` to `TrinaGrid`, so each scroll axis can have its own `ScrollPhysics`. Pair `verticalScrollPhysics: NeverScrollableScrollPhysics()` with `fitContent: true` to place a grid inside a scrolling page while keeping its horizontal scrolling (#270). @doonfrs
* Fix: `scrollPhysics` now takes effect when it changes after the grid is built. `TrinaScrollBehavior` did not override `ScrollBehavior.shouldNotify`, so scrollables kept the physics they resolved on their first build. @doonfrs
* Fix: `fitContent` now accounts for the horizontal scrollbar strip, which is a sibling of the rows viewport rather than an overlay. The grid used to come up short by that strip, leaving the rows scrollable by a few pixels. @doonfrs
* Fix: Guard the body rows scroll listeners against positions that have clients but have not been laid out yet, which threw a null check error. @doonfrs
* Fix: Keyboard navigation now scrolls all the way to the end of the grid, so the last row and last column are no longer left partially hidden under the scrollbars (#389). @doonfrs
* Fix: Frozen column rows now share the same scroll extent as the body, so Ctrl+End and vertical keyboard navigation reach the last row when frozen columns are visible. @doonfrs
